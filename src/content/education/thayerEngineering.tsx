				<p className='font-mono text-gray-800'>
					In just four years, I completed both a traditional undergraduate
					degree (double major in Computer Science and Engineering Sciences) and
					a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineeringâ€”a program typically
					requiring five years. This accelerated achievement demonstrates my
					ability to master complex technical concepts while managing multiple
					demanding workstreams.
